# Enterprise Orbit Diagram

The Enterprise Orbit Diagram is a strategic visualization model designed to help organizations understand, communicate, and reason about their software assets around a central business core.

It is especially useful in early discovery phases, low-documentation environments, and modernization initiatives where existing system landscapes are complex, fragmented, or poorly understood.


## What problem does it solve?

Many organizations struggle to explain their technology landscape in a way that is understandable to both business and technical stakeholders.

Existing documentation is often:
- Too technical for non-technical audiences
- Outdated or incomplete
- Scattered across multiple tools and formats

The Enterprise Orbit Diagram provides a single, business-centric view of enterprise software assets, enabling clearer conversations and better strategic decisions.


## What is the Enterprise Orbit Diagram?

The diagram represents enterprise systems as elements orbiting a central business core.

- The core represents the most critical business domain or capability.
- Orbiting elements represent supporting, adjacent, or external software systems.
- Visual distance and grouping help communicate relevance, dependency, and strategic importance.

## Documentation

- 📐 Diagram conventions: [docs/conventions.md](docs/conventions.md)
- 🧭 Practical examples: [docs/examples.md](docs/examples.md)
- 

## When to use it

- Enterprise discovery and assessment
- Modernization and legacy transformation discussions
- Executive and stakeholder presentations
- Alignment between business and technology teams
- Early documentation in low-maturity environments


## What it is NOT

The Enterprise Orbit Diagram is not:
- A detailed system design or architecture specification
- A replacement for technical diagrams (e.g. sequence, component, or deployment diagrams)
- A workflow or BPMN model

Its purpose is strategic clarity, not technical precision.

## Example

A basic example of the Enterprise Orbit Diagram can be found in the `examples/` folder.

## Status

This project documents a visualization pattern that has been applied in real-world enterprise initiatives.

The repository is intentionally lightweight and focused on:
- Explaining the model
- Defining clear diagramming conventions
- Sharing examples and guidance

Community feedback and contributions are welcome.
